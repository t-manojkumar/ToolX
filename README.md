ToolX - Image & Video Toolkit
A screenshot of the ToolX application interface.

A modern, all-in-one desktop application for Windows that provides a suite of powerful image and video processing tools, wrapped in a beautiful Fluent UI inspired by Windows 11.

‚ú® Features
This toolkit combines four powerful utilities into a single, easy-to-use application:

Find Best Image: Select a group of similar photos, and the app uses a scoring algorithm based on sharpness, contrast, and brightness to automatically find the best one.

Extract Frames: Load a video file, and the app will quickly extract frames, allowing you to save high-quality stills from your footage.

Image Upscaler: Enlarge images by 2x, 4x, or up to 8x their original size using high-quality Lanczos interpolation to maintain clarity.

Image Splitter: Split any image into a custom grid (e.g., 1x2 for a panorama or 2x2 for a profile grid) with just a few clicks.
